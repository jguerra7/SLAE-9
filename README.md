# SLAE
Material for the SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert (SLAE) course which I started in January of 2018.

The SLAE is an online course by SecurityTube which teaches the basics of 32-bit assembly language programming for the Intel Architecture (IA-32) family on Linux. The course coincides with information security by covering topics such as:
  - Writing shellcode
  - Making encoders/decoders
  - Making crypters
  - Egg hunting and reverse engineering applications with GDB

There are 7 unique assignments posted here which are required for successfully passing the course exam.
